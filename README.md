## **A Rational Calendar: Ending the 365th Day Debate**

### **Abstract**
This project presents a rational approach to calendar reform that eliminates the need for leap weeks.  
Instead of forcing each year to start on the same weekday, the system accepts the natural shift of weekdays between years — preserving the seven-day cycle and simplifying all date-related operations.

### **Background**
Since the Gregorian reform, many proposals have aimed to make the calendar more regular and predictable.  
As early as 1849, Auguste Comte proposed the *Positivist Calendar*, consisting of 13 equal months of 28 days each, plus one extra day outside the week.  
In the 20th century, the International Fixed Calendar League (IFCL) — also supported by the Eastman Company — promoted a similar idea, continuing its campaign until 1989.  
Despite its internal logic, the IFCL concept faced strong religious opposition due to the “blank” days that disrupted the weekly cycle.

### **Opposition**
Resistance from religious institutions was fundamental — days excluded from the week interfered with the rhythm of worship and the structure of liturgical calendars.  
For this reason, despite wide support among scientific and economic circles, the project was never implemented.

### **The Problem of Leap Weeks**
Other reform attempts introduced so-called leap weeks **to appease religious groups** and avoid introducing a “zero day” (a day outside the week).  
However, this led to **desynchronization** with the solar year.  
As a result, the difference between the calendar and astronomical year could reach **four to six days**, which for astronomers is a serious error — since their measurements may depend on milliseconds.

### **Proposed Solution**
Instead of eliminating the 365th day, the proposed model **accepts** it.  
Each new year begins on the next weekday: first Monday, then Tuesday, then Wednesday — and when a leap year occurs, the sequence naturally shifts.  
This preserves astronomical accuracy, social continuity, and removes the need for extra leap weeks or “blank” days.

### **Advantages**
This system provides several practical benefits:  
- simplified accounting and scheduling,  
- equal month lengths divisible by seven,  
- greater predictability of economic cycles — for example, cyclical settlements,  
- greater predictability of biological rhythms — including women’s menstrual cycles.
