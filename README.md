# A Rational Calendar: Ending the 365th Day Debate

## Abstract
This project presents a rational approach to calendar reform that eliminates the need for leap weeks. Instead of forcing every year to start on the same weekday, the system accepts the natural weekday shift between years — preserving the solar cycle while simplifying all date-related operations.

## Background
Since the Gregorian reform, various proposals have sought to make the calendar more regular and predictable. Auguste Comte’s *Positivist Calendar* (1849) introduced 13 equal months of 28 days, while later, the International Fixed Calendar League (IFCL) — supported by Eastman Company — promoted a similar idea, maintaining this campaign until 1989. Despite its internal logic, the IFCL concept met strong religious opposition due to its “blank” days that interrupted the weekly cycle.

## The Problem of Leap Weeks
Other reform attempts introduced so-called *leap weeks* to maintain synchronization with the solar year. However, this method complicates the calendar’s cyclical nature and leads to discrepancies of several days between astronomical and civil years — unacceptable from an astronomical point of view.

## Proposed Solution
Instead of eliminating the 365th day, this model embraces it. Each subsequent year begins on the next weekday: first Monday, then Tuesday, then Wednesday — and when a leap year arrives, the sequence naturally jumps ahead. This solution respects both astronomical accuracy and social continuity, without additional leap weeks or blank days.

## Advantages
The system offers practical benefits: simplified accounting, uniform month lengths divisible by seven, and easier prediction of recurring biological or economic cycles — including the regularity of women’s menstrual cycles, often synchronized with lunar and solar rhythms.
